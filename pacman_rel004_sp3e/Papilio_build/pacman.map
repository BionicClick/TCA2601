Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:MapLib:864 - The following Virtex Blockram(s) is/are being retargeted to
   Virtex2 Blockram(s). This will waste 75% of Virtex2 Blockram capacity. To
   obtain better utilization, Please re-run memory generator to retarget to
   Virtex2 Blockram modules:
   RAMB4_S8_S8 symbol "u_dblsacn/u_ram_a" (output
   signal=u_dblsacn/rgb_out_a<7>),
   RAMB4_S8_S8 symbol "u_dblsacn/u_ram_b" (output signal=u_dblsacn/rgb_out_b<7>)

WARNING:Pack:1237 - The register u_dac/DACout_q failed to join the output side
   of an I/O component. Symbol u_dac/DACout_q is not under the same hierarchy
   region as symbol O_AUDIO_L_OBUF. There are three ways to fix the problem:
   1. Put both symbols under the same hierarchy region and process the design.
   If the I/O buffer is being inferred by the synthesis tool, it is suggested to
   code I/O registers on the top level of code. If this can not be done, it is
   suggested to instantiate the proper I/O buffer in the lower level of code and
   disable I/O buffer inference for that port in the design.
   2. Remove KEEP_HIERARCHY constraint or add KEEP_HIERARCHY = FALSE to block
   u_dac in the UCF file.
   3. Run map with the option -ignore_keep_hierarchy (TCL/ProjNav command:
   process set "Allow Logic Optimization Across Hierarchy" TRUE). This option
   will dissolve all hierarchy in the design.

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Mapping completed.
